The thickness of the fur helps the fox survive the frigid temperatures and the white color helps it blend in with the snow in order to hide from predators.",

These fish are stinky. Since Mandarinfish don’t have any scales to protect them from predators, they are protected with poisonous spines and caked in a copious amount of smelly mucus.",
